00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,040
Hi everyone let's get started.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,530
But before diving into Python programming let's decide which ideally we will use for college.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:18,510
There are several ideas like Nadine's by jam Jupiter in sublime wishes to your core Xandra.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:29,960
So let's select one from the 10 best ideas for Python programmers and I'm going to select the main one

5
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:40,240
sublime extreme discipline picks three is one of the most powerful crossplatform like we gaudily do

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,820
is do that and for beginners it is the best idea to use.

7
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,620
So let's in-style it and before.

8
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,180
I want to show you my system configuration.

9
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:04,670
I'm using elementarily 64 bit Windu right now and all installations will be done based on this configuration.

10
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,620
Select install synoptic package manager first.

11
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:23,630
It will help you to download all the related files over Bowdler package simultaneously.

12
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:32,370
So since I have installed synoptic package banish'd you let's go to an IP package manager and install

13
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:43,740
Sublette and in the search box just type for sublight and it will list all the related items of subline

14
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,920
baggage and just pick one up label.

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:55,240
And again this Uplay button will not be files for us.

16
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,080
And before doing all these delusions and downloads and all.

17
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,820
Just make sure that you are connected to the Internet.

18
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,830
Saw this in Optik package manager have done its job.

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:22,060
So we have installed some blame you know system and the selection of the synoptic package manager or

20
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,480
software sender for downloading bobos is up to you.

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:37,600
You can select any one from this and Cinetic package manager is simpler than software Sandu I think

22
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,390
and it's completely free.

23
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,300
You can select anyone according to your convenience.

24
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,690
So let's go to these subline decks right now.

25
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,330
This is the sublime text of sublime ID.

26
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,430
And I have selected by the language.

27
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:04,190
And here we can see all the languages that suf ordered by Sublime Text.

28
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:14,930
And since we are calling in then we are selecting by then and are always here in the right cold.

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,260
In the upper position we can see something.

30
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,030
This is nothing but just the mini map.

31
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:29,240
Many map shows all the codes in the miniature forms that we are having in this country.

32
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,340
That's it.

33
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,650
And if that is disturbing you then just go to the view and hide it.

34
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,540
And we have got many other options on here.

35
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,950
File options.

36
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,540
New File Open file open folder Ixo drop options.

37
00:03:47,570 --> 00:04:02,350
I don't and using all these options and this is all we can do many things like the programming and this

38
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,330
ID in Python will be standard by the next two words.

39
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,740
So that's all for now.

40
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,850
Keep watching

41
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,750
and thank.
