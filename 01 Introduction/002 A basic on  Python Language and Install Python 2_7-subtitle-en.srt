1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:10,440
Is today I'll take you to introduction to programming language and Python programming language.

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:16,550
So before we get to know about Python programming language what actually is a programming language.

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,500
Any ideas.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,120
OK.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,360
Helio a programming language is nothing but a language which is used to communicate with the computer

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:34,430
which is nothing but the machine there many programming languages available in the market like Java

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:45,110
C++ C ash Perl dot net acceptance and Python is one among them is Python is emerging as as popular day

8
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:54,710
by day because of its simplicity and easy to use and easy to learn and also begin able to learn it in

9
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,660
a short period of time and beginning with the goal in a short period of time.

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,440
All right.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,550
Basically the languages I mean the programming languages are categorized into two depths.

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,070
One is independent languages and one is compiling languages.

13
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:20,430
Lex Noye board interpreter language.

14
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,760
All right so what I actually mean by interpretation

15
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,370
interpretation is a process of executing a program line by line.

16
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,520
It means one statement at a time that it had run.

17
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,040
So this was in the order which leaves you a programming code line by line and exit using that again

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,030
at runtime in a language that can be understand by the machine.

19
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,560
So this was your final execution.

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,610
All right.

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,630
So interpreter is the one which does this task of executing your code line by line.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,120
All right.

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,420
So this is all about independent what I actually mean by compiler.

24
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,290
Or the combination language.

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:19,830
All right so compulsion is nothing but the process of conducting the type programming called you have

26
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,860
written in a language that can be understood by the computer which is nothing but in the form of zero

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,700
Gummo Once a machine can able to understand a language which is binary that is zero.

28
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,690
So this is all that that can be understood by the Conchobar and is a Final Exit exhiliration called

29
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,190
data that a computer can able to understand.

30
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,950
So this is all about ambulation.

31
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:56,410
So compilers and interpreters are the two important topics that can be related to programming language

32
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:06,960
and some of the compiler languages or Java C++ dot net C ash etc. and some of interpretor languages

33
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,670
are by then Ruby BHB ball etc..

34
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,270
All right.

35
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,630
So let's come to bite.

36
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,160
So what does Biden Biden is an interpreter.

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,590
High-Level object oriented programming languages language which is very easy to look

38
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:38,590
so bite and that are is a main official Web site of the Biden where you have tons of material.

39
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,560
And you know a notion of bidon topics.

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,380
So this Web site contains the Biden software with the various Russians.

41
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,940
So from downloads link you've been able to see there are various versions of Biden's software available

42
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,430
to download for different options of operating systems.

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,920
So you can able to see that you've been able to download bidon software for Linux and Mac and other

44
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,080
operating systems.

45
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:17,620
Byte tree was a recent release that has many new futures and functionalities and and 2.7 was most widely

46
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,850
used and popular.

47
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:25,810
So before you get you get familiar with Python describer use this pipe and 2.7

48
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,240
so.

49
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,620
So that's all you guys.

50
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:38,130
This is a direction of bite and programming language and also introduction to programming language.

51
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,280
In our next tutorials Let's.

52
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,610
Let's let's get in deep byte and like this.

53
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,220
I mean the data Daibes syntax etc..

54
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,960
Thank you yes.
