00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,040
Hello you're with us.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:16,030
Welcome to the first among a series of tutorials to get you started with programming language.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,920
This will be a short session to help you with the basics like the features of the Python language and

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,860
how to get them to work on the machine.

5
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:32,080
With that go and let's get into your first lesson on Batan.

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:40,510
The session goes the following topics introduction to Python the fetus and setting up by an all new

7
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,100
machine.

8
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,850
Introduction to the Biden programming language was developed in the late 80s.

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:01:01,580
And it was designed from a number of other programming languages like C C++ small dog and a few others.

10
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,330
It is a high level interpreter object oriented programming language.

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:15,350
Well that's quite a few heavy terminology isn't a but well we are here to break things down for you.

12
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:26,640
The high level programming language is one that may use or disclose to natural human language or contained

13
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:35,330
elements from natural language thus making the programs simpler as an example.

14
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,650
The word friend might indeed be meaningful to a high level programming language

15
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:52,360
and interpreted language enables you to run the exact code you wrote without having to rely on someone

16
00:01:52,360 --> 00:02:02,170
else to convert your code into a language spoken by your computer with just the zeros and ones someone

17
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,000
else being a compiler.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,200
In most cases mortarboard compilers later

19
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:20,510
in object oriented programming language treats everything like real world objects or go up in object

20
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,390
oriented terms is an object and employ as an object.

21
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,990
Both of these know how to get stuff done like drive or work.

22
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,400
You write code to ask these objects to get the stuff done.

23
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,820
This is a pretty simplified explanation and made some really silly for a non beginner.

24
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:49,610
Our intention is to get all the complexity out at the beginning and we'll definitely be diving deep

25
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,570
into these concepts a little way later.

26
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,230
Moving on to features Bitin is simple.

27
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,410
Which means it is easy to learn and read.

28
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:09,620
Now we touched on the word trend a while ago when we discussed high level languages.

29
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,410
The word print does indeed have a meaning in python.

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,310
No that's your first example.

31
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:24,150
The word print followed by some text within court lets you get these text appear on the screen.

32
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,540
We shot them all for you

33
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:42,460
the word friend told by a few text

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,790
within quotes.

35
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,690
And hit enter.

36
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,710
We can see the text blowpipe them printed on the screen simply isn't it

37
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,400
moving on to the next feature that is portability

38
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,870
Peyton can run on very many hardware platforms and isn't restricted to being used in a single type of

39
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,710
machine.

40
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:26,350
It works like a charm on huge commercial enterprise so to a handheld device all of these do it being

41
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:36,030
open source which is the third feature by open source we mean anybody with enough knowledge can contribute

42
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,560
to the source code and make language better by sharing and making changes to the code.

43
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:48,460
There is a strong community backing pikemen that helps keep it Mazan strong.

44
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:55,090
Every day we shall touch on the word nice to go with the final feature on our list.

45
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:04,520
That is Lively's a huge collection of libraries in Python takes your work off from your shoulders since

46
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,270
they help you write that's called white and has tons of these written by people in the white community

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,770
who are way smarter than me.

48
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,870
It's more into how we set up the Python programming language on our machines.

49
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:33,970
On Macs like the one we're using now you are good to go by typing in the word byte in after finding

50
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,000
a diplomatic.

51
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,470
Now we'll follow this up with a simple exercise to demonstrate this concept.

52
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,830
It does begin by taking the permanent

53
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,670
to begin with and a vital interpreter.

54
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:11,370
I type in Python and press and the I mean to the Python interpreter and in order to start reading my

55
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,340
first program that is I want to print the text along.

56
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:27,570
I type in print followed by a word in quotes and press ENTER Kenzi the word hello world printed on the

57
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,110
screen.

58
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,050
Moving on

59
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:47,660
mostly gets distribution's followed the same procedure so we have that covered as well.

60
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:04,310
Addition to that we have a few that in Macs and Linux Biden 2.10 comes preinstalled.

61
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,800
But for Windows you have an additional work.

62
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:20,920
The Windows users are tuned in can listen to what you see on your screen and download the 32 bit on

63
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,740
the 64 bit installers with Jim Baker of rest of the procedures.

64
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:34,840
We have a screen grab from the website and you'll have to specifically install either of the two options

65
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,330
listed within the rectangular box.

66
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,260
With that we are wrapping up the first session.

67
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,440
We hope we got you excited about them and we look forward to meeting you the next day.

68
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,080
Until then it's goodbye.
