1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:09,500
Hello guys you'll begin to know what programming language and fighting in Israel will implement or exiguous

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,210
in Python healable.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,890
Hope you have Biden installed on your computer from this link from the official Python web site.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,090
Hope you have.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,950
You're using two pencil and a lot of the motion.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,880
You're really convenient.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,080
All right.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,680
In Python we're going to go into in two ways.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,330
One is by using the interpreter and one is by using the Python scripts.

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,010
Basically a file is called Blyton's to bite and module if it's ends with Dot people.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,470
It means python files ends with an extension of God.

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:47,870
But but if you have a very large lot of code to be executed it's better to write a script with got extension

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,800
and exit.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,540
Vigeland All right.

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:57,610
So last fall let let's implement a simple hello world program by using the interpreter.

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,200
Open the domina.

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,150
I have already opened it and the not entered into by an interpreter.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:17,220
How we can do that simple just type it down without any input arguments to it and present the that's

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,540
all.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,250
Now you are in the Biden interview.

21
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,030
These three arrow marks shows you that tells you that you entered into by an interpreter.

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,460
And now we can execute the code we want here.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,630
So let's implement a simple by Dunhills Broga

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,360
room that top that Tolland by Biden to bring up the exiguous as it will help what.

25
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,870
So let's let's understand what this is all print.

26
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,300
What has been printed is nothing but by done building function that prints any data from byte and program

27
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,860
and hellebore is a string.

28
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:06,370
So the building function and the string combines and formed and formed the Biden program.

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,180
So this is all about a simple hello world program in Python.

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:18,500
We can also implement this by then Hellawell program using byte scripts on modules as we have discussed.

31
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,740
And the second point is so let's implement this Helliwell program using scaped

32
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,240
exeat don't have speak create a Biden fight Autumn what one you

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,910
have created by done more with an extension of Darbyville that now.

34
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,530
No it was a blackflies and let's write something or some program.

35
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:06,870
This was seen as the one having been injured on the tiny know we have no single program no hope and

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,220
hoping to get it.

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:16,550
Go to Domina use the word Biden and find him.

38
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,180
There you go.

39
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:23,700
You've been able to see the string Hello all that we have been dead from the Bidens good.

40
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,800
That's all in Biden.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,280
So able to execute our programs in two ways.

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,990
One is independent and one is by scripts.

43
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,880
Let's do some meaningful.

44
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,860
When this hello world string but using some functions don't worry about disfunctions datatype etc. We'll

45
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,340
be getting too deep with these topics.

46
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,640
No extra problems for now.

47
00:03:46,830 --> 00:04:06,650
Let's bring this hello world using Python function.

48
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
All right.

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,170
We have written a simple function called Hello world and inside that we are building the word hello

50
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,600
world and def is nothing but the negation in by Biden which indicates that this was a function.

51
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,220
And finally we are calling this function to bring this hellova.

52
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,090
Let's exiguous this file from Domina

53
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,910
same as we did before.

54
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,340
Did you will you've been able to see the string hello world that we are hoping that you have executed

55
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,790
or that you have been Dinda to print that from.

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,300
Function

57
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,300
All right.

58
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:55,250
So we have seen of executing this problem in the builder and also to bite on scripts.

59
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:02,570
There are many ways to implement or to exit this program using functions with taking different arguments

60
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,680
etc..

61
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,250
So in the next two tutorial will know something.

62
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,840
Something in DB like datatypes syntax etc..

63
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,170
That's all for this tutorial guys.

64
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,340
See the next tutorial.

65
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,110
Thank you very much.
